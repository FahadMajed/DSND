The Rearrange Array Elements algorithm rearranges an array of 
integers into two numbers such that their sum is maximum. To do this,
the algorithm sorts the input array in descending order using merge sort,
and then builds the two numbers by alternating the most significant digit between them.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(nlog(n)), where n is the 
length of the input array. This is because the merge sort algorithm used 
to sort the array has a time complexity of O(nlog(n)), and the digit-building 
step requires iterating over the sorted array, which takes O(n) time.

The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(nlog(n)), 
because the merge sort algorithm requires O(n) space to store the 
temporary arrays used during the merge phase.
