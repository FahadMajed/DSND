The algorithm works by using binary search to find the target value in 
the rotated sorted array. The key idea is to use the fact that one half of 
the array must be sorted at any given time, even though the entire array may not be sorted.

We check which half is sorted and narrow down the search space accordingly. 

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n).

The space complexity is O(1)
