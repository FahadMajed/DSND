This code computes the square root of a non-negative integer input using
the Newton-Raphson method. The time complexity depends on the 
convergence rate of the Newton-Raphson method, which is typically fast. 
The space complexity is constant.
The code checks for valid input and iteratively
refines the guess until the desired level of accuracy is reached.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), where n is the input number. 
This is because the Newton-Raphson method converges rapidly to the square root,
with the number of correct digits in the approximation doubling with each iteration.

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of memory 
to store the input,the guess, and the tolerance level. 

Therefore, the time complexity is logarithmic and the space complexity is constant.
