The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative algorithm for finding the
roots of a function. It can be used to approximate the
square root of a number, by finding the root of the function `f(x) = x^2 - num`.

The idea behind the Newton-Raphson method is to start with an initial guess `x0`,
and then iteratively improve the guess using the formula:


x1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0)


where `f'(x)` is the derivative of `f(x)`. This formula gives the next guess `x1`,
which is closer to the true root of the function than the previous guess `x0`.
he process is repeated until the difference between the current guess and the previous 
guess is less than a desired tolerance.

For the case of finding the square root of a number `num`, we can use the function `f(x) = x^2 - num`. Its derivative is `f'(x) = 2x`, so the Newton-Raphson formula becomes:


x1 = (x0 + num / x0) / 2
