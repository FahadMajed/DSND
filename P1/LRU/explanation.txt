for the LRU cache, i decided to declare a cache dictiorany and a list to track the most recent calls, whenever GET is called 
the entry will be removed pushed to the ended to the list, if the cache is full, the first element in the oldest_item_tracker
will be removed since it is the least recent

COMPLEXITY:
set:
space -> O(1)
time -> O(1)

get:
space -> O(1)
time -> O(1), unless the recenecy needs and update the worst case will be O(n), and on average O(n/2)
