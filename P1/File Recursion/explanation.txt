for the File Recursion, i decided to use recurion since it is the easiest way to traverse the directories
the recursion will occur unless the provided file is not directory, then the program will check if it matches
the suffix or not

COMPLEXITY:
space -> O(n), the number of files in the directories that will be stored in [files]
time -> O(n), the number of files in the directories
