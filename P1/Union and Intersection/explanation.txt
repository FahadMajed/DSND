for the Union, I decided to loop through the first list nodes and insert them all, then insert the unique nodes from the other list
for Intersection, I decided to loop through the first list nodes, then see if the node exists in the second list, if so add
it to ther intersection

COMPLEXITY (Union):
space -> O(n)
time -> O(n), looping through the whole lists

COMPLEXITY (Intersection):
space -> O(n)
time -> O(n^2), looping through the whole list and then loop each item to the other list
