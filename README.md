# Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree Projects

Welcome to my repository for the projects completed during my Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program. This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures, as well as solutions to programming problems.

## Projects

The following is a list of the projects completed during the Nanodegree program:

1. **Project 1:** Unscramble Computer Science Problems
2. **Project 2:** Show Me the Data Structures
3. **Project 3:** Problems vs Algorithms
4. **Project 4:** Route Planner

Each project has its own folder within this repository, containing the necessary files to run and test the code.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. Additionally, some projects may require additional libraries, which will be listed in the project's `README` file.

## Usage

To run a project, navigate to the project's directory and run the Python file associated with the project. For example, to run Project 1:

```
cd P0
cd "Problem Name"
python problem_name.py
```

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Udacity and its instructors for providing the materials and guidance necessary to complete this Nanodegree program. Additionally, I would like to thank the open source community for providing many of the tools and libraries used in these projects.
